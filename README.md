'Voodoo' - Global Game Jam 2014
============

Assets so far: http://puu.sh/6xBV8.jpg

Theme:
"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."
We cannot hurt the rats directly, but we can hurt them indirectly by stabbing ourselves.

Gameplay:
You are a voodoo doll in a sewer avoiding rats who walk around.
There's a rat tail in each section of the level that you must get.
If you get the rat tail, you'll then stab yourself and the rats will blow up opening the way to the next area.
In following areas, there will be colored rats and colored tails so you'll have to get both in order to progress.
Your goal is to get some thing at the end.  Not sure what it is.

Details:
Rats blowing up with be particle effects and rat pieces thrown around with physics.  Somewhat gory but satisfying.
When you touch a rat you die and fall apart.  Your pieces will be persistent and you'll instantly respawn back at the start of the area.
I only plan on doing 3 or so areas.  Bare minimum is that I want to have one area done today with start and finish.
